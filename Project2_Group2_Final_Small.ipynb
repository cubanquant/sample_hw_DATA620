    "We analyze from a social network perspective the United States Senate voting patterns in the 113th Congress of two types of roll calls: Senate initiated bills and presidential nominations.  Our goal is to find, visualize and interprete patterns of coordinated voting behavior.  Is voting always split along party lines or do other factors emerge?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part I, we discuss Senate initiated legislation and analyze the network patterns.  We discuss the background of Senate voting, describe the questions to be addressed.  We also discuss the dataset which is common for both Parts I and II. We find that overall polarization does exist in the Senate of the 113th Congress based on the voting patterns of Senate bills. We locate smaller factions of Senators within each party with very common voting records along with the identification of one Senator with a voting pattern more in line with the opposition party for a subset of bills.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part II, we discuss Senate nominations of high official positions to the Cabinet, judiciary and various agencies.  We use network projection methods to find clusters within both senators and nominations.   The results can be explained by variations in liberal-conservative ideology, duration of Senatorial service, branch of government and other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Parts use a social network analysis approach to study this dataset.   By modeling Senate rollcall votes as a 2-mode network (a bipartite graph) of Senators and rollcalls, we can apply the arsenal of graph theory.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "US Senate voting patterns are well documented public data.   Our data source was the voteview website [www.voteview.com] which published Congressional voting data of both chambers from the establishment of the Republic to its current Congress.   Extensive prior work has been done to model voting patterns using statistical methods.   The most famous model is the DW-NOMINATE model developed by political scientistis Kevin Poole and Howard Rosenthal  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOMINATE_(scaling_method).  Poole and Rosenthal also co-created the voteview.com website.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis attempts to answer three questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the level of polarization within the Senate of the 113th Congress?\n",
    "2. Do smaller factions of Senators exist with similar voting patterns within each party?\n",
    "3. Does any Senator appear to vote more in line with the opposition party?\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We use data for the 113th Congress which convened from January 3, 2013 - January 3, 2015 during the fifth and sixth years of the Barack Obama presidential administration.   The 113th Congress refers to both chambers:  House of Representatives and the Senate.   We focus on the Senate which normally has 100 active voting members (2 per State).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of 3 files obtained on https://voteview.com/data\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `S113_members.csv` contains the list of 105 members of the US Senate.  \n",
    "   * `S113_rollcalls.json` contains the set of legislative roll calls including bills, procedural motions, nominations, cloture votes.  It contains metadata as well.\n",
    "   * `S113_votes.csv` contains a dataframe of votes made by each Senator for each rollcall item from `S113_rollcalls.json` discussed earlier.  It also refers to the members by a foreign key in `S113_members.csv`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "The legislative rollcalls are identified with the scope of the dataset by a `bill code` and a `rollcall number`.  For example, the nomination of Jacob Lew as Secretary of the Treasury is identified by `bill code` `PN40` and by `rollcall number` `26`.   The `rollcall number` is unique to each item to be voted while the `bill code` is associated with the legislation or nomination as well as procedure voted like cloture.  Each Senate member is uniquedly assigned a 5 digit `icpsr` numeric code.  For example, Barbara Boxer has icpsr code 15011."

    "### Nuances of the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Changes of Membership\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 105 senators because of changes in membership due to death or resignation.   While the Senate normally has 100 active voting members, during the 2 year period of the 113th Congress, changes arose.  These changes were:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Death of Frank Lautenberg, NJ - Democrat on June 3, 2013 - replaced by gubernatorial appointment of Jeffrey Chiesa, NJ - Republican on June 6, 2013.\n",
    "*  Replacement of Jeffrey Chiesa, NJ - Republican on Oct 31, 2013 by Corey Booker, NJ - Democrat due to a special election following the death of Frank Lautenberg.\n",
    "*  Replacement of John Kerry, MA - Democrat on Feb 1, 2013 who become US Secretary of State by Mo Cowan by gubernatorial appointment.\n",
    "*  Replacement of Mo Cowan, MA - Democrat on July 16, 2013 by Ed Markey, MA - Democrat by special election.\n",
    "*  Replacement of Max Baucus, MT - Democrat on February 11, 2014 by John Walsh, MT Democrat on February 11, 2014\n",
    "\n",
    "Source:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/113th_United_States_Congress#Changes_in_membership\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Votes are Cast\n",
    "\n",
    "Another nuance concerns the outcome of each Senator's vote.  It is not binary.   Formally, there are 10 different results that could be recorded for each vote.   For our purposes, we collapse them down to 3 outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  `Yea` - a Yes vote in the affirmative on the motion, bill or nomination.\n",
    "*  `Nay` - a No vote\n",
    "*  `Present` - equivalent to choosing not to vote for multiple reasons.  We also treat absent votes in the `Present` category.  It favors neither Yea or Nay.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the importance of this dataset, the quality of rollcall voting data is very high.   Highly accurate recordkeeping is essential for both the passage of legislation and the operation of government.\n",
    "While some data transformations were made for this analysis, no data corrections were required to our knowledge.\n",

    "\n",
    "The President of the United States nominates officials to certain high positions with the advice and consent of the Senate.   Such positions include federal judges, ambassadors, Cabinet level officials, directors or heads of regulatory or law enforcement agencies. During the 113th Congress, the Senate considered and approved 188 nominations.  105 Senators participated in some or all of the nomination rollcalls but only 100 active members at any one time. Typically nominations are not rejected because the nominee is not considered for a full Senate vote unless the administration and Senate leaders have the required votes to proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the 113th Congress, the Senate was controlled by the Democratic party with 53 members in the Democratic Party and 2 independents who caucused with the Democrats for a total of 55 votes.  The Republican side hasd 45 members.  The 10 vote advantage to the Democratic party enabled it to pass legislation which became more difficult in the 114th Congress when control shifted to the Republican Party.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis considers two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Did Senators vote for presidential nomination in a coordinated manner based on a network analysis of the rollcall voting?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Did nominations show clustering due to coordination of Senatorial rollcall voting?   If so, is the clustering related to the department of the nomination?\n",

    "\n",
    "*  The set $A$ of senators is encoded by their `icpsr` code.  There are 105 senators as stated earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  The set $B$ of rollcalls is split into two sets based on `yea` or `nay` outcomes.   $B_y$ is the set of nodes representing yea votes on a nomination.   $B_n$ is the set of nodes representing `nay` votes on a nomination.\n",
    "Since $\\lvert  B \\rvert = 188$, there are twice as many nodes \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lvert B_y \\rvert + \\lvert B_n \\rvert = 2 \\cdot \\lvert B \\rvert = 376$$.\n",

    "This approach has some advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  construct a undirected, unweighted graph that encodes all the voting information \n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Senate confirmation of Presidential appointees exhibits properties of social networks.   \n",
    "\n",
    "These appointments can define a bipartite network which yields interesting insights when applying the island method on edge weights of the bipartite projection.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we project the graph on the senators, the traditional party division is visible but differences do exist between parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  For the Democrats, clusters seems to form around a centrist ideology for most Senators with another cluster formed around liberal and conservative factions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  For Republicans, the main cluster forms around approval of popular non-ideological appointments but also disapproval of ideologically unacceptable candidates.   \n",
    "\n",
    "*  Republicans seems to have a larger number of maverick senators.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we project the graph on the nominations, different clusters emerge:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  one large cluster centers around the judiciary \n",
    "\n",
    "*  another cluster around contested appointees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do these clusters occur?  We cannot only speculate as the data does not speak for itself in this case.  Senatorial politics is governed by coalitions seeking to pass or deny appointments.  A great deal of bargaining takes place before the confirmation vote.  Even the occurrence of a vote signals progress.  For example, nominations can be stalled by opposition for months.   Cloture votes may be necessary to silence opposition or filibusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clusters represent categories of approval and disapproval of appointments for high ranking government positions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The value of social network analysis is to\n",
    "\n",
    "*  quantify the proportion of each category of nominations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  quantify the density of clusters of similiar nominations\n",
    "\n",
    "*  quantify future changes in polarization of the parties as Senate margins shrink or grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we observe that the 113th Congress was unusually contentious and unproductive in which nominations were the most substantive action taken.  (https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2016/5/17/11693956/113th-congress-unusual)  In hindsight, it is hard to see the current 117th Congress being much more productive as the Democrats' margin is now zero.\n"
